Geek Education is a coding academy that offers courses to youth of ages 6 to 12. Their website was created in 2018 to promote their courses. After 6 months live, the founders realized that the website created more questions than answers from proactive parents looking for fulfilling activities for their children.

**My goal is to create a website that provides precise information to help parents and students to choose extra-curricular activities for their kids, that fosters curiosity in young students and helps the founders to better communicate the values of the company.**
