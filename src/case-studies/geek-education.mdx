Geek Education is a coding academy that offers courses to youth of ages 6 to 12. Their website was created in 2018 to promote their courses. After 6 months live, the founders realized that the website created more questions than answers from proactive parents looking for fulfilling activities for their children.

**My goal is to create a website that provides precise information to help parents and students to choose extra-curricular activities for their kids, that fosters curiosity in young students and helps the founders to better communicate the values of the company.**

## The company message

I met with the company founders and realized that although there were many ideas in the air, they had not formally defined a business plan. I gathered their thoughts and motivations and created a Lean Canvas to take a snapshot of the current situation. This helped me understand the message that they wanted to send to their customers.

- **We make it fun**: use of gamification to teach complex subjects.

- **Learning path**: create an incremental learning plan for the students.

- **Care for students' growth**: expose students to external resources to encourage self-learning.

- **Small classes**: promote participation and communication in the classroom.

## Why a redesign?

After a careful analysis of the academy website, discovering the business goals and the ongoing issues customers were having, I came to the following conclusions:

- The company **values were not visible** on the website.

- The website **does not guide users** to take decisions.

- Many parents call the office asking for **information that is already given** on the website.

- More than **90%** of the users **leave the site** after visiting the homepage
