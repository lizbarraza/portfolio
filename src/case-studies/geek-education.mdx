# The Goal

<TwoColumns>

<TwoColumnsImage src="../images/geek-education/goal.jpg" />

<TwoColumnsText>

How might we **help parents to choose extra-curricular activities** for their kids, that foster curiosity in young students and helps the founders to better **communicate the values** of the company?

</TwoColumnsText>
</TwoColumns>

## Main obstacles

- **Diverse client demographic:** potential clients include parents from Eastern and Western origins. Both groups have different ways to see education. Having limited access to interview families of eastern background, I supported my study interviewing non-parents users form this group, and in research studies related to this field.
- **Lack of a web developer:** Halfway through the project, the web developer committed to building the website left the project, so I had to implement the design ideas using only the components of the WordPress template used by the company.

## Motivations

During my work in the company as an instructor, I noticed the following issues from parents looking for coding classes:

- Many of them, came to the academy requesting information that was already given on the website.
- Most of them had no knowledge of programming languages and were confused when taking the decision to enroll in a program.

I decided to take on this project to improve the experience of the customers and attract new clients.

# Business goals

I met with the company founders and gathered their thoughts and motivations using a Lean Canvas. This helped me understand the message that they wanted to send to their customers.

## Key metrics

- _"We want to increase registrations of students taking more than 1 level"_
- _"We need to group students, to have at least 3 students per class"_

## Unique value proposition

- **Fun class environment:** use of gamification to teach complex subjects.
- **Offer a learning path:** create an incremental learning plan for the students.
- **Care for students' growth:** encourage self-learning.
- **Small classes:** promote participation and communication in the classroom.

## Problem definition

After a careful analysis of the academy website, discovering the business goals and the ongoing issues customers were having, I came to the following conclusions:

- The company **values were not visible** on the website.
- The website **does not guide users** to make decisions.
- Many parents call the office **asking for information that is already given** on the website.
- More than **90%** of the users **leave the site** after visiting the homepage.

<StickyNavigationSection name="User research">

# User research

I took on a **guerrilla research** mission. I made a list of the things I needed to know and documented my assumptions for each of them. I wanted to compare these assumptions with answers gathered from the real world.

<TwoColumns>

<TwoColumnsImage src="../images/geek-education/user-research.jpg" />

<TwoColumnsText>

- **Who** is looking for coding classes?
- **What** do they know about coding?
- **How** did their children get interested in coding?
- **How** long they want to commit to a program?
- **How** do they decide to sign up for classes?
- **Why** many of the students are boys?
- **What** do parents expect after completing a course?
- **When** do the parents think their children are prepared to learn to code?
- **How** often they want to attend classes?

</TwoColumnsText>
</TwoColumns>

After this, I recruited parents with kids, looking for coding classes. The session was divided in two parts: **Interview** (background, familiarity with tech, objectives and motivations) and **usability testing** (observe interaction with the current website)

## Findings

- Parents are not familiar with technology names and they need guidance to choose an appropriate course.
- They looked for an appropriate and friendly environment for learning, and qualified teachers.
- The main motivation is to find something that their kids would enjoy.
- They need to fit a course in their busy child's schedule.
- Most of them already understand that learning to code is important, and they don't need to be convinced.
