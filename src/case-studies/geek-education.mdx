## Main obstacles

- **Diverse client demographic:** potential clients include parents from Eastern and Western origins. Both groups have different ways to see education. Having limited access to interview families of eastern background, I supported my study interviewing non-parents users form this group, and in research studies related to this field.
- **Lack of a web developer:** Halfway through the project, the web developer committed to building the website left the project, so I had to implement the design ideas using only the components of the WordPress template used by the company.

## Motivations

During my work in the company as an instructor, I noticed the following issues from parents looking for coding classes:

- Many of them, came to the academy requesting information that was already given on the website.
- Most of them had no knowledge of programming languages and were confused when taking the decision to enroll in a program.

I decided to take on this project to improve the experience of the customers and attract new clients.
